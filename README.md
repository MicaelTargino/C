# The goal
  This repo was created to store my studies and practices while studying the fundamental of the C language, documenting my progress into leaning the syntax and the memory management.

  As I continue to deepen my knowledge in the field of computer science, I'm exploring more advanced topics such as data structures and algorithms. Documentation of these advanced topics will be maintained in a separate repository to keep the studies organized and focused.

## Milestones Descriptions

### ✅ Pointer Basics

- ✅ Write a program to declare an integer and a pointer to an integer. Assign the address of the integer to the pointer and change the value of the integer using the pointer.
- ✅ Create a function that swaps the values of two integers using pointers.

### Pointer Arithmetic

- ✅ Given an array of integers, write a program to print the array using pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing.
- ✅ Modify the above program to reverse the array using pointer arithmetic.

### Pointers and Functions

- ✅ Write a function that returns the length of a string using a pointer to traverse the string (without using the `strlen` function).
- ✅ Implement a function that takes two pointers to integer arrays and their sizes as parameters, and prints the sum of each element in the arrays (assume both arrays are of the same size).

### Pointer to Pointer

- ✅ Demonstrate the use of a pointer to a pointer by modifying a variable at three levels of indirection.
- ✅ Create a 2D array using a pointer to a pointer and fill it with values, then print the 2D array.

### Function Pointers

- ✅ Write a function that takes a function pointer as an argument and calls the function pointed to.
- ✅ Implement a simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using function pointers where the operation is chosen at runtime.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

- ✅ Use `malloc` and `free` to dynamically allocate memory for an array of integers and fill it with random numbers, then free the memory properly.
- ✅ Create a program that uses pointers to copy a string to another string dynamically allocated (without using `strcpy`).

### Structures and Pointers

- ✅ Define a structure for a student (including name, age, and GPA) and demonstrate how to access and modify its fields using pointers.
- ✅ Write a function that sorts an array of structures containing student information by GPA using pointers.

### Dynamic Size Arrays

- ✅ **Implement a Vector**: Create your own dynamic size array (similar to C++ vector) that can resize itself as items are added or removed.
- ✅ **Merge Arrays**: Write a function to merge two dynamically allocated arrays into a new dynamically allocated array, ensuring no memory leaks.

### Strings

- ✅ **String Concatenation**: Write a function that concatenates two strings dynamically, ensuring the resulting string is properly null-terminated.
- ✅ **Reverse String**: Create a function to reverse a string in place without using any additional dynamic memory allocation.
